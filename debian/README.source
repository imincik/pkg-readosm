readosm for Debian
------------------

The original tarball has been repacked because it contained OSM data to run
buildtime tests, which were licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution
Share-Alike license 2.0, which isn't considered suitable for Debian main.

Therefore these data have been removed from the tarball.
